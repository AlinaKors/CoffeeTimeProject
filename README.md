## Styling Notes

The design is minimalistic, but fully complies with the template provided in the terms of reference.
It is also adapted for mobile devices and is responsive. Executed in warm colors, which will be pleasing to the eye both in the daytime and at night.
All colors are taken, close to the shade of coffee, which corresponds to the theme of the site itself.

Also made button animations without using JS, for more optimization. (Button animations are made in different variations to demonstrate the work with CSS).

Ant Design was used for the form and custom input customization using CSS.

## SEO & Accessibility

- Meta tags and dynamic <Head> configuration for title, description, OG, TwitterCard, Schema metadata.
- Semantic HTML: Sections, article, landmarks (<main>, <header>, <footer>) for screen readers.
- ALT text for all images.
- use ARIA-attr for custom video player

## Performance

The project is optimized for fast loading, responsiveness and efficient rendering. The following decisions have been made to improve performance:

- By utilizing Vite, development happens with minimal latency.
- This project uses React Player to embed and play video and audio from various sources.
  -- Use light: Allows you to display a preview image instead of a video before playback starts, reducing page load time.
  -- Using the playing attribute: Video or audio does not start playing until the user initiates an action, saving resources.
- The project uses React.memo to improve performance and prevent unnecessary rendering of components.
